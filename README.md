# SAP UI5 Demo – Purchase Order Approval

This is a personal demo app I built in 2025 to refresh my SAP UI5/Fiori development skills.

It shows a list of mock Purchase Orders with fields like PO_ID, Vendor, Status, and Amount.  
I created it as a learning project while preparing to re-enter the SAP domain after working in logistics in Germany and Poland.

## Features
- JSONModel with hardcoded PO data
- List display with vendor + amount
- Responsive layout using Fiori components

## Future Improvements
- Add filtering or search
- Connect to real OData or CAP service
- Add object page navigation

## Technologies Used
SAP UI5, XML View, JSONModel, JavaScript
